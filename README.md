# HackerNews

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.0.5.

## Approach

1) Used angular material for the crisp UI
2) Used Highcharts for the better graph representation and the updation feature
3) Local Storage to make the app persistence
4) graph and data updation on hide and data upgrade
5) maintain the length with the data hide
6) Delete functionality to be implemented at the backend right now we delete the element of a particular page while rest remains the same to reduce the unnecessary overload.
Right now it shows table is empty and allows you to move further
Refresh functionality maintains the current state that has been modified by the user
